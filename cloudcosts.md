> Brief Description

Navigating the Cost Management and Billing dashboards on both Azure and GCP was fairly simple. The lack of services or data made it difficult to visualize data or utilize the filters. 

I was able to run a cost estimate on a hypothetical workload in GCP. I was able to see the price variations based on regions for Cloud Storage.

The Cost breakdown tab seems to be quite helpful once you have data.
